/*
  DEBUGGING ACTIVITY: Score Tracker

  You've been hired by a small game company to help debug their score-tracking system.

  The code SHOULD:
  1. Keep track of several players and their scores
  2. Increase or decrease a player's score
  3. Reset all scores to zero
  4. Return the name of the current top scorer

  However, some functionality isn't working correctly.

  YOUR TASKS:
  1. Run this file and observe what happens
  2. Identify 3 bugs in the code
  3. Fix all 3 bugs
  4. Record a 2-4 minute video explaining:
  - What you expected to happen
  - The bugs you found (what's wrong and why)
  - The fixes you implemented
