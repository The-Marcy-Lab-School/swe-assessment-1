# Mod 1 Assessment: Grading Rubric

**Total Points: 85 points**

---

## SECTION 1: SHORT RESPONSE (48 points, ~56%)

**8 questions × 6 points each = 48 points**

Each question is graded on two components:

### Technical Score (0-3 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Exemplary** | • Answers ALL parts of the question completely<br>• Demonstrates deep understanding with specific, accurate technical details<br>• Explanation is clear, precise, and shows mastery of the concept<br>• Uses correct terminology throughout |
| **2 - Proficient** | • Answers most parts of the question<br>• Demonstrates solid understanding with mostly accurate technical details<br>• May have minor inaccuracies or lack some depth<br>• Generally uses correct terminology |
| **1 - Developing** | • Answers only some parts of the question<br>• Shows partial understanding but contains significant gaps or errors<br>• Lacks clarity or specificity<br>• Misuses some technical terminology |
| **0 - Incomplete** | • Does not answer the question or answers incorrectly<br>• Shows fundamental misunderstanding of the concept<br>• No meaningful technical content |

### Writing Quality Score (0-3 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Exemplary** | • No spelling or grammar errors<br>• Markdown renders correctly (code blocks, formatting)<br>• Logical flow with smooth transitions<br>• Main ideas are immediately clear<br>• Concise and free of jargon or unnecessary complexity<br>• Professional presentation |
| **2 - Proficient** | • Few minor spelling/grammar errors (1-2)<br>• Markdown mostly renders correctly<br>• Generally logical flow, minor transition issues<br>• Main ideas are clear with some effort<br>• Mostly concise and readable |
| **1 - Developing** | • Multiple spelling/grammar errors (3-5)<br>• Markdown has rendering issues<br>• Unclear structure or poor flow<br>• Main ideas are hard to identify<br>• Unnecessarily complex or hard to follow |
| **0 - Incomplete** | • Numerous errors that impede understanding<br>• Markdown completely broken<br>• No clear structure<br>• Incomprehensible or extremely unclear |

## SECTION 2: CODING FLUENCY CHECK (24 points, ~28%)

**6 questions × 4 points each = 24 points**

Each question is graded on two components:

### Algorithm Score (0-3 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - All Tests Pass** | • Algorithm solves the problem efficiently<br>• All test cases pass<br>• Correct logic throughout |
| **2 - Almost There** | • Minor implementation error (wrong argument order, off-by-one error)<br>• OR missing edge case guards<br>• One small fix would make all tests pass<br>• Demonstrates understanding of correct approach |
| **1 - Significant Issues** | • Multiple implementation errors<br>• OR major algorithmic/tool selection error<br>• Shows some understanding but fundamental problems |
| **0 - Does Not Work** | • Algorithm produces no solution<br>• Solution is grossly incorrect<br>• Does not demonstrate understanding |

### Code Style (0-1 point)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1 - Clean Code** | • No linting errors<br>• Descriptive variable names<br>• No unused/commented code<br>• No syntax errors |
| **0 - Style Issues** | • Has linting errors, syntax errors, poor variable names, OR unused code |

## SECTION 3: SIMPLE DEBUGGING (3 points, ~4%)

**3 questions × 1 point each = 3 points**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1 point** | Test passes |
| **0 points** | Test fails |

**Note:** This section is auto-graded by test suite.

---

## SECTION 4: COMPLEX DEBUGGING + VERBAL COMMUNICATION (10 points, ~12%)

**1 video submission = 10 points**

### Bug Identification (3 points)

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bug 1 | 1 point | Correctly identifies the off-by-one error in loop condition |
| Bug 2 | 1 point | Correctly identifies the assignment operator vs comparison operator error |
| Bug 3 | 1 point | Correctly identifies the missing object property reference |

### Bug Fix Implementation (3 points)

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Fix 1 | 1 point | Implements working fix for off-by-one error |
| Fix 2 | 1 point | Implements working fix for assignment operator error |
| Fix 3 | 1 point | Implements working fix for missing property reference |

### Verbal Response Quality (4 points)

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Technical Vocabulary** | 1 point | Uses precise technical terms (e.g., "comparison operator" not "equal sign", "strict equality operator" not "three equal signs", "assignment operator", "object property", "array index") |
| **Completeness** | 1 point | Addresses all parts of the prompt (identifies bugs, explains why they cause issues, describes fixes) |
| **Clarity** | 1 point | Explanation is easy to follow with logical order; viewer can understand without confusion |
| **Conciseness** | 1 point | Stays within 2-4 minute time limit; no excessive rambling; gets to the point |
